# Project

- Added new item to ROADMAP regarding using `.gitignore` file as default file
- Added husky dependency for pre-commit hooks
- Added special pre-commit hook to check if **CHANGELOG.md** contains Cyrillic characters (since developer writes CHANGELOG as quickly as possible in native language and this could sometimes accidentally end up in push due to oversight)
